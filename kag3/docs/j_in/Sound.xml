<ptitle>Playing Sound Effects</ptitle>
Sound effects must be in Wave (PCM) format. Either WAV files or formats that can be played through plugins can be used.<r/>
<r/>
For sound effect playback, there are basically three main tags: playse, stopse, and ws (there are also other tags and functions for features like sound effect fading).<r/>
For example, to play se1.wav, write it like this:<r/>
<r/>

<bq>
[wait time=200]<r/>
*start|Start<r/>
[cm]<r/>
Playing sound effect.[l]<r/>
<b>[playse storage=se1.wav][ws]</b><r/>
</bq>
While the playse tag starts playing the sound effect, it doesn't wait for playback to finish, so the ws tag is used to wait for the sound effect to finish playing.<r/>
Setting <tt>loop=true</tt> in the playse tag enables loop playback. In this case, you cannot wait with the ws tag.<r/>
Also, the stopse tag stops sound effect playback.<r/>
